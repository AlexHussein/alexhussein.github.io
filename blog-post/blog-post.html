      <h2>Red Wine Lyrics</h2>
      <p>One of the world’s most popular red wine grapes, Cabernet Sauvignon’s origins come from southwestern France. The grape came about as a result of crossing Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc during the 17th century. It’s grown in almost every major wine producing country as it can thrive in a variety of climates. Cabernet Sauvignon is used in Bordeaux wines because it blends well and balances with other wines such as Merlot and Cabernet Franc.</p>
      <p>Cabernet Sauvignon produces a deep, red colour with high to medium tannins and moderate acidity. Typically full bodied, it has notes of black cherry, mint, blackcurrant, dark spices and cedar. As Cabernet Sauvignon can be grown around the world, its flavours and aromas are vast, although most have a long, smooth finish. Most Cabernet Sauvignons are ready to drink right away, but often benefit from aging.</p>
      <p>Cabernet Sauvignon has traditionally been the world’s most planted premium red wine grape, and was only surpassed by Merlot in the 1990’s. It can be found throughout British Columbian wine country, and in parts of Ontario.</p>
      <p>Cabernet Sauvignon is a great wine to pair with food, specifically red meats, due to its high tannins. Enjoy it with steak, beef or other red meats, roasted bell peppers or moderate to strong cheeses.</p>
